# PyBer_Analysis
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
For business rasons there's need to know the total rides thar are given for each type of city from January to May, the result where the following:

## Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
But to the better understand of how the user share rides depending on the type of city, we decide to made a multiple linear graph (each por type of city) taking a week as a time difender.

### Business recommendations
1. Even when the average fare per driver is less, the urban city is the one with the highest amount of rides and total fares
2. The worst city to invest is the rural, because is the one with the lower amount of rides and the highest average fare per driver
3. Suburban could be the most promise city becuase it has less than the half of total rides as the urban, but made the half amount of total fares as urban.
